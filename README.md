Monumental Archive Project

This was developed for the Digital Archaeology Institute at Michigan State University 2015-2016. 

As a PhD student working in historic cemeteries in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Caribbean, I have repeatedly faced the same problem: there are a lot of people doing great work recording funerary monuments but very little access to the data afterwards. This limits historical research by restricting sample size and comparative studies, but it also results in the constant repetition of work that has already been done. A rich historical record already exists, if only it was accessible.

The Monumental Archive Project (MAP) will act as an open database of historic cemeteries to address accessibility and sustainability issues whilst stimulating creativity. It will act to:

<p>1)    preserve and provide access to existing records (and encourage data reuse);</p>
<p>2)    stimulate new research and engagement with historic cemeteries (an at-risk heritage resource);</p>
<p>3)    and establish collaborative networks and discussions between diverse interest groups.</p>

The pilot content for this project will be records of monuments in Barbados (~2000 monuments, 16 cemeteries), from my own research, including inscriptions, location, and material descriptions (style, iconography, font, material). It is hoped that this will encourage the contribution of data/content for the website to grow the database in following years. The structure of the website will therefore be designed with the flexibility to accommodate what will hopefully be a growing resource. 

It uses Bootstrap templates for the structure of the site, in addition to Derek Eder's CSV-to-HTML-Table code (https://github.com/derekeder/csv-to-html-table) to create a searchable html table.
